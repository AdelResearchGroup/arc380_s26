    "Instead of directly calling the script using Python (e.g., `python src/arc380_session08/arc380_session08/my_script.py`), using ROS 2 entry points with `ros2 run` is preferred for several reasons:\n",
    "- **Package integration**: `ros2 run` ensures your node is executed within the context of the installed ROS 2 package, using the correct environment and dependencies.\n",
    "- **Consistent workflow**: All ROS nodes (Python and C++) are launched the same way, which keeps development consistent across projects.\n",
    "- **Dependency resolution**: Entry points rely on the installed package metadata, so imports and package paths are resolved correctly.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Larger projects often contain multiple executables. Entry points provide a clean way to expose multiple nodes from a single package.\n",
    "- **Professional practice**: In real ROS development, nodes are run via `ros2 run` or launch files, not by manually calling Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quick testing during development, running a script directly can be more convenient. However, your final package should always build successfully and run via `ros2 run` to ensure that the node behaves correctly as part of the ROS 2 ecosystem.\n"
