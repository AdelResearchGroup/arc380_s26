    "\n",
    "**ROS (Robot Operating System)** is an open-source middleware and ecosystem for building robot software.  \n",
    "It provides conventions, libraries, and tools that make it easier to build **distributed** robot systems composed of many small processes that communicate over well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common reasons to use ROS:\n",
    "- **Modularity**: break a robot application into reusable components (nodes).\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: standardized message, service, and action interfaces across packages.\n",
    "- **Tooling**: logging, introspection, debugging, visualization, and simulation tools (covered next week).\n",
    "- **Ecosystem**: large community and many reusable packages.\n",

    "## 1.1. ROS 1 vs ROS 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "ROS 2 was designed to address limitations of ROS 1 for modern robotics use cases (multi-robot, unreliable networks, real-time, security, embedded).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences you should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture & transport\n",
    "- **ROS 1**: centralized discovery via the **ROS master** (`roscore`). Transport typically uses TCPROS/UDPROS.\n",
    "- **ROS 2**: decentralized discovery via **DDS** (Data Distribution Service). No single master required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication behavior\n",
    "- **ROS 1**: limited built-in control over transport behavior.\n",
    "- **ROS 2**: **QoS (Quality of Service)** controls reliability, durability, history depth, deadlines, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build system & packages\n",
    "- **ROS 1**: `catkin` + `rosbuild` history; common workspace style: `catkin_ws`.\n",
    "- **ROS 2**: `ament` + `colcon`; common workspace style: `ros2_ws`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-time & embedded\n",
    "- **ROS 2**: designed with real-time and embedded deployments in mind (executor/callback model, DDS implementations, lifecycle nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "- **ROS 1**: no standard security.\n",
    "- **ROS 2**: DDS Security (SROS2) provides authentication, encryption, and access control (when configured).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we focus on the **ROS 2 computation graph** and the core communication primitives: **topics, services, actions**.  \n"

    "- Your node registers **callbacks** (e.g., “when a message arrives”, “every 0.1s”).\n",
    "- An **executor** spins and dispatches callbacks.\n",
    "- For this workshop, you can treat `rclpy.spin(node)` as “run the node until shutdown”.\n",
